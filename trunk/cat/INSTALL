Installation instructions
=========================

(This file is currently stupid. GNU GPL v3 requires me to make installation
instructions, and even though the following information is defective and
incomplete, a programmer might actually save half an hour from reading it.
Nominally now I fulfill the v3 installation instruction's requirement, although
praxis show that all instructions are deficient outside of a clearly declared
context, and by defining a context restrictive enough (f.ex. “the reader ought
to be a mindreader and guess my intentions”) the installation instructions are
implicitly provided in the Makefile).

Requirements
============

	* PostgreSQL

or other relational database management system (RDBMS).

Download
========

make a subversion checkout from sternons by:

$ svn checkout http://sternons.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sternons-read-only

In Windows all commands of course should occur in a cygwin shell window.

mkmap
=====

See ../mkmap/INSTALL

cat
===

The directory ‘cat’ contains two database tables providing

1. Tabulae Rudolphinae published by Jacob Bartsch, the son-in-law of Johannes
   Kepler; everything sponsored by the Roman-German emperor Rudolph II with
   interests in astrology and the occult,

   file: tabulae-rudolphinae.db
   source: http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html

2. A catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, analysed
   by E. B. Knobel
   
   file: alachsasi-knobel-1895.db
   source: http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1895MNRAS..55..429K/0000429.000.html

Tabulae Rudolphinae
-------------------

$ cd sternons/trunk/cat
$ cp tabulae-rudolphinae.db ~/data/

In PostgreSQL create a table for Tabulae Rudolphinae by

joe=# CREATE TABLE Tab_Rud (
joe(#     tr_row int,
joe(#     tr_num int,
joe(#     description varchar(80),
joe(#     longitude varchar(7),
joe(#     latitude varchar(7),
joe(#     magnitude varchar(3),
joe(#     occurrence int,
joe(#     abbreviation varchar(4),
joe(#     page integer
joe(# );

and then import it by

joe=# COPY Tab_Rud FROM '/home/joe/data/tabulae-rudolphinae.db' DELIMITER '|';

It probably works similarly in most other database systems with anything like
standard compliance.

The original table is pretty well reproduced by the command:

joe=# SELECT * FROM Tab_Rud ORDER BY tr_row;

The table contains page information not representing stars (or supernovae),
namely those where tr_num = E'\n', so only stars are selected by:

joe=# SELECT * FROM Tab_Rud WHERE tr_num = E'\n' ORDER BY tr_num;

This presents stars measured up by Tycho Brahe, by Hipparchos/Ptolemy and by the
Dutch southern sky observers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman
(in the table erroneously attributed to Johannes Bayer).

The entries tr_num between 1 and 1008 are from Brahe, although it has been
theorized that he actually measured up slightly less than 1000 and extrapolated
the rest from either deficient own observations or positions from
Hipparchos/Ptolemy. Two are not stars, but instead the reknowned supernovae of
Tycho in Cassiopeia and Kepler in Ophiuchus. These have trno in (221, 267).

The entries tr_num between 1008 and 1305 are from Hipparchos/Ptolemy not
measured up by Brahe.

The entries tr_num between 1305 and 1439 are from Keyser and de Houtman.

Al Achsasi Al Mouakket according to E. B. Knobel
------------------------------------------------

$ cd sternons/trunk/cat
$ cp alachsasi-knobel-1895.db ~/data/

In PostgreSQL create a table for Achsasi star table by

joe=# CREATE TABLE Achsasi (
joe(#     num int,
joe(#     arabic_name varchar(40),
joe(#     designation varchar(6),
joe(#     longitude varchar(6),
joe(#     latitude varchar(5),
joe(#     zone varchar(1),
joe(#     magnitude varchar(4),
joe(#     knobel_name varchar(40)
joe(# );

and then import it by

joe=# COPY Achsasi FROM '/home/joe/data/alachsasi-knobel-1895.db' DELIMITER '|';
