        TITLE: Scan Sexagesimal                                                 
        FILE: 1-Scan60                                                          
        STATUS: vapor, not evaluated                                            
        DESCR: Scan sexagesimal notation for floating point numbers meaning     
          that 00h23m45.67s equals 0 + 23/60 + 45.67/3600.                      
        CAVEATS: this is not a unit, it is a way to express a different number  
          system and scale analogous to degrees vs. radians and decimal vs.     
          hexadecimal. How these are to be differentiated is unclear since      
          degrees can be expressed sexagesimally while radians cannot, and      
          00h23m45.67s implies a different scaling than 00Â°23'45.67", so that   
          there is a partial conceptual overlap between sexagesimal and scaling 
          (units).
