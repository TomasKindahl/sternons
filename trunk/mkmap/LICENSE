In short I peruse GNU GPL3 for program code, but data that I use to generate star
maps is in Public Domain, as well as the generated star maps.

All files in the directory of this LICENSE file are covered by the GNU General
Public License version 3, except the database files in the subdirectory db/, the
map files in maps/ and the image files in images/. All files in these three
subdirectories are Public Domain and not covered by any license, because the
data sets derives from free data available in http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/.
Because my intention is that the SVG:s shall be changed without any restriction
whatsoever, it is suitable that also the map files are Public Domain.

My code files adapt to GNU GPL3 in order to optimize the ease of integration of
other OpenSource code. The license conditions of GNU General Public License
version 3 can be found in the accompanying file COPYING.
