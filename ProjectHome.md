## Sternons ##
(Gothic **staírnons** 𐍃𐍄𐌰𐌹𐍂𐌿𐍉𐌽𐍃 = stars)

### Purpose ###
This is intended to be a collection of loosely related amateur astronomers tools, interconnected not necessarily with nice GUIs, but foremost by task related documentation that enables the user to use the tools to her/his own liking.

The tools are intended to ease amateur observation preparations such as printing out relevant star maps, but they also presume a basic text interface knowledge.

### Licensing ###
The codes herein are covered by GNU GPL for maximal volunteer collaboration potential¹. One exception to this is generated sample code (postscript, PDF, pgplSQL, etc.) and data (database data, SVG etc.), which are derived from publicly available star catalogues (such as those from [CDS catalogue service Strasbourg](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/cats/Cats.htx) ²), and therefore should be public domain, according to the **holy** [Golden Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Rule) ethics. The attached documentation will explicitly list each file, and whether it is to be sorted under GNU GPL or whether it is public domain by their respective nature.

> ¹) In [revision r101](http://code.google.com/p/sternons/source/detail?r=101) I changed the license from GNU Lesser General Public License to GNU General Public License. The reason is that I cannot incorporate GNU GPL code into my code unless I have a GNU GPL license myself (so called viral license). A little annoying, yes, but any mayhap code user who want a **special license** for their copy of MY code can contact me and get a special permit — if to use another OpenSource license, then for free, of course.

> ²) files containing copyright notices such as [NGC 2000.0](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?cat=VII%2F118%2F) from Sky Publishing Corporation won't be supported: we here adher to OpenSource, which Sky Publishing Corporation don't.

### Current code ###
Peruse the [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/sternons/wiki/Wiki?tm=6)

### Coding philosophy ###
**Unix philosophy:** a set of small well-designed tools interacting through text interfaces, with which to collate a larger, more general tool.

For now, there is no philosophy on preferred programming language(s), and whether such a preference is needed. The coding intention is towards making the tool set fairly operating system independent, so selection of GUI:s is geared towards portability. Java is very popular according to portability measures, but isn't suitable for fast data generators such as planet orbit computations. Java might be topical when making integrating tool callers and GUI:s. OpenGL might be topical for graphical 3D browsers.

### Development ###
The development philosophy is directed towards keeping the loosely knit tool-kit design of the tool kit, while integration GUI:s and integration scripts are welcome as well.
This is in order to make at least some tools compileable and usable in as many operating environments as possible.

### Participation ###
The organization for collaboration is not yet explored, so for now, please wait some time until the full potential of google code is explored, and how it may interact with some other fora for the purpose, f.ex. the Nordic [Astronomiguiden](http://www.astronomiguiden.se) (Swedish speaking, sorry!). If you are of the impatient kind, please prefer mailing ![http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MxYhWlE4m7A/UXpj2jsa7VI/AAAAAAAAAI0/Crf_EvibMDQ/s320/email.png](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MxYhWlE4m7A/UXpj2jsa7VI/AAAAAAAAAI0/Crf_EvibMDQ/s320/email.png) .
