Installation instructions
=========================

(This file is currently stupid. GNU GPL v3 requires me to make installation
instructions, and even though the following information is defective and
incomplete, a programmer might actually save half an hour from reading it.
Nominally now I fulfill the v3 installation instruction's requirement, although
praxis show that all instructions are deficient outside of a clearly declared
context, and by defining a context restrictive enough (f.ex. “the reader ought
to be a mindreader and guess my intentions”) the installation instructions are
implicitly provided in the Makefile).

Requirements
============

Linux:
	* gcc
	* gmake (GNU make)
	* glibc (always installed when installing gcc)
	* subversion
Windows:
	* cygwin
	* gcc
	* gmake (GNU make)
	* subversion

Download
========

make a subversion checkout from sternons by:

$ svn checkout http://sternons.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sternons-read-only

In Windows all commands of course should occur in a cygwin shell window.

mkmap
=====

compile mkmap
--------------

Go to mkmap directory:

$ cd sternons/svn/trunk/mkmap

In Windows make

$ make mkmap.exe

then test images

$ make winimg

In Linux just

$ make

and test images

$ make img

cat
