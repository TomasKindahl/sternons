_User manual:_ 

_Development:_ *[mkmap]* is going to generate a star map in SVG format

*Purpose:* a script for generating [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG SVG]
and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript PostScript] star maps from a
configuration file.

*Current state:* Prealpha code generating star maps such as for example the one
above (the easily recognized
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation) constellation of Orion]), 
the command for generating _any_ star map being:
{{{
 ./mkmap star.db > cmap.svg
}}}
For now the direction and scaling is hard coded in the source code in the 
[http://code.google.com/p/sternons/source/browse/trunk/mkmap/mkmap.c?r=2 main program]
as
{{{
 image_struct *frame = new_image(500, 500, 1.4);
 proj_struct *projection = init_Lambert_deg(80, 0, 10, 20);
}}}
but this is an atrocity and must ASAP be fixed by loading a config file.

*Hack plan:*

 # _introduce mkmap language_: the language loads a program then runs it, the program may contain setups of environment, then drawing stars and other objects, either by an object drawing command, or by a database load where a list of objects is constructed and each object is then drawn.
  * R₀: the current state (2010-08-01) is that the star drawing is hard coded, as per above,
  * R₁: next is that a settings file that does nothing is loaded
  * R₂: thereafter the settings file that only changes the chosen projection and frame is loaded, the map must still be supplied as an argument
  * R₃: the map is loaded by the "settings file" which is now a program,
  * R₄: an extra output file is supplied as an argument.
