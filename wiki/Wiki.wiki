= Introduction =

Sternons aims at being a loose tool set for astronomy, such as scripts and
programs interfacing each other according to the
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy Unix philosophy]. Sternons is
decidedly jealous on [http://pp3.sourceforge.net/ PP3] for it's professionality
and nice and beautiful documentation. However PP3 has some very unUnician
dependencies: it requires LaTeX and ghostscript. Also it generates PDF or
!PostScript, not an easy data format, such as SVG. Sternons aims at being
composed of *very* losely knit tools, more like a Swiss army knife for
generating this-or-that astronomy database, connection, interface, image or
whatever.

*Purpose:* a script for generating [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG SVG]
and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript PostScript] star maps from a
configuration file.

*Current state:* Prealpha code generating star maps such as for example the one
above (the easily recognized
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation) constellation of Orion]), 
the command for generating _any_ star map being:
{{{
 ./mkmap star.db > cmap.svg
}}}
For now the direction and scaling is hard coded in the source code in the 
[http://code.google.com/p/sternons/source/browse/trunk/mkmap/mkmap.c?r=2 main program]
as
{{{
 image_struct *frame = new_image(500, 500, 1.4);
 proj_struct *projection = init_Lambert_deg(80, 0, 10, 20);
}}}
but this is an atrocity and must ASAP be fixed by loading a config file.
