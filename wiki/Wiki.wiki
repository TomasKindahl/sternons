= Introduction =

Sternons aims at being a loose tool set for astronomy, such as scripts and
programs interfacing each other according to the
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy Unix philosophy]. Sternons is
decidedly jealous on [http://pp3.sourceforge.net/ PP3] for it's professionality
and nice and beautiful documentation. Besides being very limited, such as only
being capable of equatorial star maps, PP3 also has some unUnician dependencies:
it requires LaTeX (?) and ghostscript. Also it generates PDF, !PostScript or
LaTeX â€” not easy, nor standard image data formats. A better one would be SVG,
which is the standard vector format nowadays (in defence of PP3, it was
developed before the consolidation of SVG, and LaTeX was _fairly_ standard, but
not anywhere near as widely supported as SVG).

Sternons aims at being composed of *very* losely knit tools, more like a Swiss
army knife for generating this-or-that astronomy database, connection,
interface, image or whatever. The reasoning for this is that if sternons doesn't
build in its entirety in a certain environment, at least some parts of it should
build, their execution being inspectable so that a hobby programmer should be
able to either run the tools separately and hand-generate something workable, or
be able to fix the bugs and make it run in his/her environment independently.

In comparison to PP3, the counterparting mkmap will not try to call any external
program like PP3 does. It will simply generate. An external program has to do
the display the further conversion to PNG. This will make mkmap portable, while
independent scripted applications have to do smart things that guide the user
through the creation process of map specification to a PNG file.

_User manual:_ 

_Development:_ *[mkmap]* is going to generate a star map in SVG format

*Purpose:* a script for generating [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG SVG]
and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript PostScript] star maps from a
mkmap program file.

*Current state:* Prealpha code generating star maps such as for example the one
above (the easily recognized
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation) constellation of Orion]).
